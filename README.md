#Goal of the App:

This app strips the MP3 audio off any YouTube video selected through an android app. The YouTube videos are displayed in a visual list with image + title, and can be played from within the app. Once the request for mp3 extraction is submitted, the app will also download the resulting mp3 file to the phone.



#Description:

RaiPoll is a voting service that allows you to visualize unfiltered and unbiased opinion of the world about things that interest you. Ask questions that interest you and people give their opinion based on your options. The complex results are displayed using meaningful, simple and clear charts that can be shared as images. Every user votes anonymously and has access to the aggregate information/results/analytics. All users have equal rights and can post and follow questions and their results.
Ask people about recommendations, experiences, travels and just plain fun stuff. See what the world thinks about issues related to politics, sports, celebrities, food, love, life and many more.
